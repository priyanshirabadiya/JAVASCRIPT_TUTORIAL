1. what is javascript?
=> javascript was introduced in 1995 as way to add programms in web pages by Brendan Eich.
=> It has made modern web applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload
for every action.
=> Javascript is not programming language it is scripting language.

3. what is scripting language?
=> scripting language is type of programming language which is execute runtime environment using terpreter rather than a compiler.

2. what is difference between programming and scripting language?
=> A programming language is generally built for complex software applications where as scripting language is used to do automating tasks, it is interpreted mean it is directly run without compiling first.

6. what javascript can do?
=>javascript give html designers to a programming tool
  javascript can put dynamic text into an html page
  javascript can react event
  javascript is also used to provide validations also
  javascript can also be used to store data into locastorage,sessionstorage or in cookies also.

4. javascript is syncronys?
=> yes javascript is synschronous single-threaded language which execute the code one by one ex. it only execute line of code after completing one execution line.

5. Ajax 

6.javascript variable ?
=>in programming language variables are contaiers which are used to store information.
    variables are also called containers
    in javascript there are three types of 
    1. var
    2. let 
    3. const
    and explain it all.

7. what is mutable and imutable in javascript?
=>A mutable value is one that can be changed without creating an entirely new value, in comparison with immutable values.
=>An immutable value is one whose content cannot be changed without creating an entirely new value, in comparison with mutable values.

8. what is dynamic programming>
=> it is programming language which manage multipel operations at run time.
   it provide flexibility. This allows developers to write more adaptable and concise code.

9. what are different datatypes present in javascript? 
1.primitive datatypes:
=> primitive datatypes are simple , predefined type like integers and booleans.They are known for its simplicity to use in storing single value.
int , float , booleans , string , undefine , null , symbol(to store unonymous and unique values)
2.non-primitive datatype:
=>Non-primitive structures like arrays and lists are designed for organizing collections of data and enabling advanced data manipulation.
Primitive data types can store only a single value. To store multiple and complex values, non-primitive data types are used.
object , array(one kind of object in js) , function 

10.Hoisting in Javascript.
=>Hoisting is the default behaviour of javascript where all the variable and function declarations are moved on top.

11. Why do we use the word “debugger” in javascript?
The debugger for the browser must be activated in order to debug the code. Built-in debuggers may be switched on and off, requiring the user to report faults. The remaining section of the code should stop execution before moving on to the next line while debugging.

12.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.
Both are comparison operators. The difference between both the operators is that “==” is used to compare values whereas, “ === “ is used to compare both values and types.

13.
Syntax error => when there is any issue in syntax that cause syntax error like we to give variable like @varname it is not allowed by syntax than it cause a syntax error 

Reference Error => The ReferenceError object represents an error when a variable that doesn't exist (or hasn't yet been initialized) in the current scope is referenced

Type error => an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function that is cause of type error. error on const reinitialize


14.
Implicit conversion
The compiler automatically handles the conversion without requiring any special syntax in the source code. Implicit conversions are usually successful and don't result in data loss. For example, in Visual Basic, an integer can be implicitly converted to a double.

Explicit conversion
The programmer manually changes the data type of a value using a type conversion keyword or function.
    

15. array in javascript.
The Array object, as with arrays in other programming languages, enables storing a collection of multiple items under a single variable name, and has members for performing common array operations.

push() => push method add elements in array at last position of array it works like stack in dsa.
unshift() => unshift method add elements in array at first position of array. 

pop() => push method delete elements in array at last position of array it works like stack in dsa.
shift() => unshift method delete elements in array at first position of array.
