// console.log(sum(range(1, 10)));

// oprators have generally two types binary & unary
// unary opeartor
// Not all operators are symbols. Some are written as words. One example is the
// typeof operator, which produces a string value naming the type of the value
// you give it.
// Operators those that take one operand are called unary operators
// The minus operator can be used both as a binary operator and as a unary operator.

// example
// console.log(typeof 4.5)
// console.log(-(10-5));


// binary operator
// Operators that use two values(operands) are called binary operators. 

// Ternary operator
// A operator that use three values(operands) are called ternary operator.
// ? : 
// console.log(true ? 1 : 2)
